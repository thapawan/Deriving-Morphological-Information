# Download Sentinel 1 SAR data for free. 

Sentinel-1 is a Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellite developed by the European Space Agency (ESA) as part of the Copernicus program. It provides high resolution radar imaging of the Earth's surface, regardless of weather conditions and time of day. 

The Copernicus data space ecosystem provides free access to Sentinel-1 SAR data products, which are valuable datasets for research, decision making and support system.

The size of the images is large (7GB) and it may vary based on region. Because Interferometric Wide Swath (IW), having three sub-swaths, has three images in single polarisation and six images for dual polarisation. EW, having five sub-swaths, has five images for single polarisation and ten images for dual polarisation products.

# Senor Modes - Interferometric Wide Swath (IW)
The Interferometric Wide (IW) swath mode is the main acquisition mode over land and satisfies the majority of service requirements. 
It acquires data with a 250 km swath at 5 m by 20 m spatial resolution (single look). For more information please visit: https://sentinels.copernicus.eu/web/s...

# Product Type: Single Look Complex (SLC) and Ground Range Detected (GRD)

## Single Look Complex (SLC) 
Level-1 Single Look Complex (SLC) products consist of focused SAR data, geo-referenced using orbit and attitude data from the satellite, and provided in slant-range geometry. Slant range is the natural radar range observation coordinate, defined as the line-of-sight from the radar to each reflecting object. 

## Ground Range Detected (GRD)
Level-1 Ground Range Detected (GRD) products consist of focused SAR data that has been detected, multi-looked and projected to ground range using the Earth ellipsoid model WGS84. The ellipsoid projection of the GRD products is corrected using the terrain height specified in the product general annotation.
